# buzzIn

buzzIn is a real-time application that allows users to simulate "buzzing in" as if they were on a game show. Built with AnguarJS and Socket.io, users can load the app on their mobile device and press the button to submit an answer. There is also functionality for an "Admin" to view teams, keep score and change rounds. Enjoy!

### How to install

`git clone` the repo

```
cd buzzIn
npm install
npm start
```

Visit **localhost:3000** and enjoy!

### How to play
The "admin" user would be your very own 'Steve Harvey' - whoever is running and hosting the game. They click 'Start a game' while any other players can then 'Join a game.'
Players can buzz-in after a question has been read or they are ready to answer. The "admin" will see who was first to buzz-in and can add or remove points based on correct or incorrect answers. Players can also view the scores during play. To begin a new round, the "admin" simply hits "New Round" to reset the buzzers and proceed to the next round. Have fun!
