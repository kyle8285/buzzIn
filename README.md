# buzzIn

buzzIn is a real-time application that allows users to simulate "buzzing in" as if they were on a game show. Built with AnguarJS and Socket.io, users can load the app on their mobile device and "click" a button to submit an answer. There is also functionality for an "Admin" to view teams, keep score and change rounds. Enjoy!
